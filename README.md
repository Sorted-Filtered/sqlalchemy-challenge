Project Description

Sqlite file was used with SQLAlchemy to analyze climate data from Hawiian stations. Analysis was done using pandas, matplotlib was used in plotting data, and datetime was also used. Flask was then used to create an API using the same data. 

Execution

Put both app.py and climate_analysis.ipynb in a folder with another folder named Resources. Inside Resources is a sqlite file named hawaii.sqlite, and two excel files named hawaii_measurements and hawaii_stations. 

Features

Folder includes app file for creating an API using Flask, excel data/sqlite file in the Resources folder, and a jupyter notebook file named climate_starter for the analysis.

Contributors

EdX class code examples were loosely used for the entire project. Example used for combining flask routes was found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14023664/flask-url-route-route-several-urls-to-the-same-function
